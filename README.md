# Wedding-Venues
First-year wedding-venue website. The wedding.php file is the file that contains the wedding website's main page. Files "count.php", "catering.php" and "capacity.php", including the links to the files on the wedding website, are extra parts to my coursework that I was not allowed to meddle with other than solve. As this website is hosted on my University's domain, you cannot access it without the Univerity's wifi. I have created another link to the websites but the wedding venues will not appear after using the filter for all the venues are connected to my University's SQL.

The link to my wedding coursework without working search: http://weddingcoursework.c1.biz/
